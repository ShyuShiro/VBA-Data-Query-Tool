# VBA-Data-Query-Tool
Summary: Tool that interfaced with OSISoft Pi to output millions of rows digestible for Spotfire, JMP, or Tableau

Goal:

- Create a tool that can be used by anyone (non-programmers) that can quickly and simply compile multiple Pi Data tags across multiple bioreactors.
- Output (the millions of rows of data) is output in a table format easily digestible by software such as Spotfire, JMP, and Tableau

----- See powerpoint for full details! (All numbers in the output slide are randomized and are not real. No file provided because I don't feel comfortable releasing script which may potentially have my work's info on it)
